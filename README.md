## Intro

:laughing: Welcome to my humble repo :)

I'm Ben Chen, currently a junior student majoring in CS. The repo records my every notes, materials and codes of the courses that I've taken seriously. I might not express my solutions well so if you have problems understanding my writing, please feel free to raise an Issue or reach me via my email `chanben04gz [AT] gmail [DOT] com`. Also if you'd like to contribute to this repo, please directly create a PR!

> [!NOTE] 
> Due to my preference for system security, I did not (and will neither) enroll most of the AI related courses like Machine Learning (CS401) and Intelligent Robotics (CS405). Sorry for not covering them. Please refer to other repos for those courses.

## Structure

Basically the folders under each course are
- **Assignment** Programming or Theory assignment
- **Lab** Reports and practices
- **Exam** Final and midterm tests
- **Slides** Lecture materials
- **Text** Textbook and reference

Mostly, assignments, notes and reports are written in Typst or $\LaTeX$.

The notes can be viewed on my [blog](https://blog.benx.dev). ~~I haven't written any, though.~~

## How to Learn with the repo
It depends on you, trust yourself. As tips, you can preview the slides before the semester starts so as to have a general idea of the course, or even better, you will master the course if you're a quick learner. Also, you can refer to the solutions to check if you're right or not, and review the exams to see if you've mastered the course.

### DON'T
- Don't ignore the lectures even if you've acquired the contents, as they will most likely contain some significant details that are not included in the slides ~~(why is that? I guess the professors forget)~~.
- Don't learn for the sake of exams, like paying attention to barely what the professor says to be tested. You will not learn anything.
- Don't copy the codes or answers directly from the repo. Though labs and assignments are tough, they're the essence of the course, especially for computer science. (learning by doing is the best way to learn CS)

### DO
- Hacking is much appreciated, no matter if it's irrelevant to the courses. You will learn a lot from it. For example, it's encouraged to actually use linux and vim and so in your daily life and follow the [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).
- Ask smart questions. Searching and solving problems by yourself is a basic skill for CS students. Questions only come up after you've tried everything, and you can express the issue clearly.
- Pay more attention to art. It's not a joke. Art will not only enrich your taste, but also improve your creativity and organization aibility.
