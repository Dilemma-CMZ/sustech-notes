# Modern Western Philosophy (SS149)

This course is not computer related but essential for science thinking. Though the final grade is not satisfying, I learnt a lot from this course. The instructor is a analytic philosopher, so the course might seem boring and tough for some students. Well, all philosophy courses are tough and mind-blowing.

### Essay

For more details, see [Essay Questions](./Essay/EssayPresQuestionsEMWP.pdf).

Choose exactly one question from the list of questions and critically evaluate the question. The evaluation should be based on the following [criteria](./Essay/ArgumentAdvice2024.pdf):
- Identify the premises and conclusion of thoughts, and provides a construction of the argument.
- Check the validity and soundness of the argument, and evaluate it.
- Determine one possible weakness of the argument and provide an objection.
- Provide a response to the objection, i.e., defend the argument or revise it.

### Presentation

The talks should cover another question from the list, and similar structure as the essay.
