\section{Conclusion}
In our project, we investigate the microarchitectural vulnerability of modern processors and focusing on the cache-based side channel attacks.
With thorough understanding of the attack surfaces, we preliminarily replicate the Spectre, Phantom and Downfall on x86 machines.
Next, we analyze the feasibility in the open-source RISC-V core, XiangShan, and conduct experiment of attacks on it.

From the project, we gain a clear experience and knowledge in the area of microarchitectural security that modern processors are facing with.
Being more familiar with those knowledge, we plan to develop hardware mitigation against microarchitectural attacks.
