Microarchitecture vulnerability is unclear on open-source RISC-V processors due to the
agile development. However, the open-sourceness of these IPs facilitates the analysis of
the side-channel vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown. It is crucial to identify these
flaws in the pre-silicon stage \cite{teesec}. Additionally, we have found some
recent state-of-the-art attacks that have not been validated on RISC-V processors.

With this initiative, we conducted a comprehensive research
on side-channel attacks, and replicated them on X86-64 chips.
Next, we analyzed the public documents and source code to address the vulnerable components.
Using an open-source RISC-V processor OpenXiangShan by simulation and FPGA, 
we migrated and re-implemented three attack primitives in our study,
Spectre\cite{spectre}, Phantom\cite{phantom} and Downfall\cite{downfall}.
