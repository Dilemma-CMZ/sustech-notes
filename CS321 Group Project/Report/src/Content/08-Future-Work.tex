\section{Future Work}
\paragraph{Exploiting the Architecture}
Due to the limitation of time and lack of knowledge, the actual attack on the vector extension of RISC-V and phantom execution remains incomplete.
We plan to further address the root cause of the malfunctioning attack.

\paragraph{Mitigating the Transient Attack}
Hu et al.\cite{sok} summarize the possible hardware mitigation against the transient attack. 
Due to the speculation, software mitigation aims to block the transient window by enabling memory barrier. 
However, this causes huge performance overhead. Therefore, it's more applicable to implement hardware mitigation, such as the
branch shadowing and buffer shadowing. These techniques block the unauthorized access to sensitive data.
