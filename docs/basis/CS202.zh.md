## Project

The project topic remains the (possibly) forever, to build a CPU from scratch. Though the codes are available online, it's strongly recommended to write your own without referring to any existing code. General steps are as follows:
 1. Understanding the design of single-cycle CPU from the textbook but I won't suggest referring it due to the flaws in that design.
 2. Based on your understanding, draw the figure of your CPU from scratch, which means to redesign the datapath within your mind without referring the textbook, on paper or using any software like [draw.io](https://draw.io).
 3. Pay attention to the scalability of your design, i.e., how to extend the ISA esaily in your design. And you will know why textbook is wrong.
 4. Try implemeting the full version of RV32I, or it'll be hard to extend the ISA in the future since it requires to modify the design heavily.
 5. On the basis of well-functioning, try to optimize the design, like pipelining, hazard handling, cache, branch prediction, etc.

 Have fun with your CPU design!
