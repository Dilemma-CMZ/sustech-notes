# Welcome to my notes

## Intro

这是一份南科大计算机系的自学资料，也是我的课程资料备份。

妮可计系的课对零基础的同学来说过难，但对想认真学习计算机的同学来说又有点不够。但是，只要你有一定的自学能力，这些课程都是可以自学的。

!!!note   
    由于本人对系统和安全比较感兴趣，我并不打算选人工智能相关的选修课，如智能机器人(CS401)，机器学习(CS405)等。 请参考其他同学的仓库，或者如果你愿意贡献，请直接提PR。

## Structure

本wiki按照培养方案的课程等级划分，分为基础课、核心课和选修课。

- Basis: The basic courses for CS major, including the math courses, the programming courses and the data structure courses.
- Core: The core courses for CS major, including the algorithm courses, the system courses and the software engineering courses.
- Elective: The elective courses for CS major, including the computing theory, security and AI.

Mostly, assignments, notes and reports are written in Typst or $\LaTeX$.

The notes can be viewed on my [blog](https://blog.benx.dev). ~~I haven't written any, though.~~
