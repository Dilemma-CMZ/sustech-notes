# Welcome to my notes

## Intro

This wiki aims to help to teach yourself the CS courses in SUSTech, and also severs as a backup for the course materials.

CS major in SUSTech is a bit hard for those who have no background in computer science, but it's not enough for those who want to learn computer science seriously. However, as long as you have some self-learning ability, these courses are all self-taught.

!!!note
    Due to my preference for system security, I did not (and will neither) enroll most of the AI related courses like Machine Learning (CS401) and Intelligent Robotics (CS405). Sorry for not covering them. Please refer to other repos for those courses. Or if you'd like to contribute, please feel free to do so.

## Structure

The wiki is organized according to the course leve, which are basis, core and elective.

- Basis: The basic courses for CS major, including the math courses, the programming courses and the data structure courses.
- Core: The core courses for CS major, including the algorithm courses, the system courses and the software engineering courses.
- Elective: The elective courses for CS major, including the computing theory, security and AI.

Mostly, assignments, notes and reports are written in Typst or $\LaTeX$.

The notes can be viewed on my [blog](https://blog.benx.dev). ~~I haven't written any, though.~~

## How to Learn with the repo
