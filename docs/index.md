# Welcome to my notes

## Intro

This wiki aims to help to teach yourself the CS courses in SUSTech, and also severs as a backup for the course materials.

这是一份南科大计算机系的自学资料，也是我的课程资料备份。

CS major in SUSTech is a bit hard for those who have no background in computer science, but it's not enough for those who want to learn computer science seriously. However, as long as you have some self-learning ability, these courses are all self-taught.

妮可计系的课对零基础的同学来说过难，但对想认真学习计算机的同学来说又有点不够。但是，只要你有一定的自学能力，这些课程都是可以自学的。

!!!note
    Due to my preference for system security, I did not (and will neither) enroll most of the AI related courses like Machine Learning (CS401) and Intelligent Robotics (CS405). Sorry for not covering them. Please refer to other repos for those courses. Or if you'd like to contribute, please feel free to do so.
    
    由于本人对系统和安全比较感兴趣，我并不打算选人工智能相关的选修课，如智能机器人(CS401)，机器学习(CS405)等。 请参考其他同学的仓库，或者如果你愿意贡献，请直接提PR。

## Structure

The wiki is organized according to the course leve, which are basis, core and elective.

本wiki按照培养方案的课程等级划分，分为基础课、核心课和选修课。

- Basis: The basic courses for CS major, including the math courses, the programming courses and the data structure courses.
- Core: The core courses for CS major, including the algorithm courses, the system courses and the software engineering courses.
- Elective: The elective courses for CS major, including the computing theory, security and AI.

Mostly, assignments, notes and reports are written in Typst or $\LaTeX$.

The notes can be viewed on my [blog](https://blog.benx.dev). ~~I haven't written any, though.~~

## How to Learn with the repo
