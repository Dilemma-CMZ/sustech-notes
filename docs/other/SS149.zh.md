# Modern Western Philosophy (SS149)

This course is not computer related but essential for science thinking. Though the final grade is not satisfying, I learnt a lot from this course. The instructor is a analytic philosopher, so the course might seem boring and tough for some students. Well, all philosophy courses are tough and mind-blowing.
